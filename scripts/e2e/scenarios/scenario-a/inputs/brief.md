# Project brief (tech-agnostic)

We are building an online learning platform.

## Business goals

- Enable learners to purchase subscriptions or one-off courses.
- Provide search and recommendations.
- Track learner progress and course completion.

## Users
- Learners (web + mobile)
- Instructors (web)
- Administrators (internal)

## Data
- User profiles and entitlements
- Course catalog metadata
- Media assets (large files)
- Quiz content and results
- Progress events (high volume)

## Constraints
- We have a small team.
- We need to launch an MVP within 8 weeks.
- We expect 10k monthly active users in year 1.

## Compliance & security
- Personal data must be protected.
- Payments must be handled securely (use a third-party payment processor).
